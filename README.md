## 技能生成规则
### 主要规则
1. 代价（资源）Cost * 代价转换效率 Cost Fact = 能量 Energy = 效果 Power * 效果消耗因素 Power Fact
2. 一个技能（skill）只有一种代价（Cost）？
3. 代价支持的效果类型有限，且效果的各数值能量加起来为总能量

### 支持的代价
1. 蓝，支持的效果类型：直接念力伤害（包括dot伤害，debuff），强化属性（持续回合buff）（描述可以多样比如具现化武器），治疗？
2. 占用蓝上限，支持的效果类型：被动buff，召唤？
3. 血量，支持的效果类型：强化属性（），回蓝？

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
